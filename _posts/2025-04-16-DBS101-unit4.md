### DATABASE SYSTEM FUNDAMENTAL

1. SQL Joins
Purpose: Combine data from multiple tables to analyze relationships.

Inner Join: Matches rows where a common column exists in both tables.

Natural Join: Automatically matches columns with the same name.

Outer Joins:

Left Join: Keeps all rows from the left table and adds matching rows from the right (unmatched areas are filled with "empty" values).

Right Join: Opposite of Left Join.

Full Outer Join: Combines all rows from both tables, filling gaps with "empty" values.
Why it matters: Joins help merge related data, like linking patient records to appointments in a hospital database.

2. Views and Materialized Views
Views: Virtual tables created by queries. They simplify complex queries (e.g., showing only faculty from the "SWE" department) and restrict sensitive data access.

Materialized Views: Physical copies of query results stored for quick access. They update automatically when the original data changes.
Why it matters: Views streamline workflows, while materialized views speed up frequent queries on large datasets.

3. Integrity Constraints
Rules to ensure data accuracy and reliability:

Entity Integrity: Unique identifiers (like student IDs) prevent duplicate entries.

Referential Integrity: Ensures relationships between tables stay valid (e.g., a course must belong to an existing department).

Domain Constraints: Restrict values (e.g., age must be ≥ 18).
Why it matters: Prevents errors like assigning a patient to a non-existent doctor.

4. SQL Data Types
Date/Time: Track events (e.g., appointment dates).

Large Objects: Store files like images (BLOB) or long text (CLOB).

Auto-Increment: Automatically generate unique IDs (e.g., invoice numbers).
Why it matters: Ensures data is stored efficiently and accurately.

5. Indexes
Purpose: Speed up data retrieval by creating shortcuts.

Unique Indexes: Enforce uniqueness (e.g., no two employees can have the same ID).
Why it matters: Makes searching large tables (like a library catalog) faster.

6. Authorization
Control who accesses or modifies data:

Privileges: Permissions like viewing (SELECT), adding (INSERT), or deleting data.

Roles: Groups (e.g., "admin" or "student") simplify permission management.
Why it matters: Protects sensitive data (e.g., only doctors can update patient diagnoses).

7. SQL in Programming Languages
Dynamic SQL: Build queries on-the-fly (e.g., search filters in an app).

Embedded SQL: Predefined queries in code for specific tasks (e.g., generating reports).
Why it matters: Bridges databases with apps, like displaying products on a website.

8. Functions and Procedures
Functions: Reusable blocks that return values (e.g., calculating a patient’s age from their birthdate).

Procedures: Reusable blocks for actions (e.g., scheduling appointments after checking doctor availability).
Why it matters: Reduces repetitive code and enforces business logic.

9. Triggers
Purpose: Automate actions when data changes (e.g., logging edits to a student’s grade).

Use Cases: Alerts, audits, or cascading updates (e.g., restocking inventory when a product sells out).

Limitations: Risk of infinite loops or performance issues if overused.
Why it matters: Maintains data consistency without manual effort.

10. Recursive Queries
Purpose: Analyze hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts or product categories).

How It Works: A query repeatedly references its own results until no more matches are found.
Why it matters: Simplifies tasks like mapping parent-child relationships in a family tree.

11. Advanced Aggregation
Purpose: Summarize data in complex ways (e.g., sales trends by region and quarter).

Concepts: Grouping sets, totals, and subtotals.
Why it matters: Supports decision-making with insights from large datasets.

Key Takeaways:

SQL is versatile for querying, securing, and automating data tasks.

Joins and recursive queries handle relationships and hierarchies.

Constraints, indexes, and triggers ensure data quality and efficiency.

Authorization and roles protect sensitive information.

Integrating SQL with apps (via JDBC/ODBC) connects databases to real-world use cases.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of a database as a library.

Indexes = Catalog cards to find books quickly.

Views = Curated book lists (e.g., "Best Sci-Fi").

Triggers = Automatic alerts when a book is due.

Authorization = Librarian controls who can borrow rare books.
