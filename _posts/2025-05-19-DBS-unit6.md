### Topic : Database Systems Fundamentals

Key Learnings:

Indexing (Lesson 14)
Indexes are special lookup tables that speed up data retrieval by reducing full table scans

Types: Ordered (sorted) and Hashed (uniform distribution via hash function)

Ordered Index Types:

Clustering/Primary: Records stored in same order as index (often primary key)

Non-clustering/Secondary: Records not sorted by index

Dense vs Sparse: Dense has entries for all values, sparse only for some

Multilevel indexing: Creates indexes on indexes to reduce disk reads

B+ Trees: Most common index structure - balanced, efficient for insertions/deletions

Query Processing (Lesson 15)
Three main steps: Parsing/translation, optimization, evaluation

Query plans specify how to execute operations (algorithms, indices to use)

Cost measurement: Focuses on disk I/O (block transfers, seeks) and CPU usage

Execution methods:

Materialization: Stores intermediate results

Pipelining: Passes results directly between operations

Join algorithms: Nested-loop, block nested-loop, indexed nested-loop, merge join

Sorting: External sort-merge for large datasets

Query Optimization (Lesson 16)
Process of selecting most efficient query evaluation plan

Uses equivalence rules to transform expressions

Join ordering significantly impacts performance

Cost-based optimization explores all equivalent plans, chooses least costly

Heuristics like performing selections early reduce optimization overhead

Nested subqueries should be avoided/decorrelated when possible

Points to Remember:
Proper indexing is crucial for query performance

B+ Trees maintain efficiency despite insertions/deletions

Query optimization minimizes resource consumption, not just response time

Join ordering can dramatically affect intermediate result sizes

Pipelining often outperforms materialization by avoiding temporary storage

Statistics about data distribution help estimate operation costs

Simple queries are easier to optimize than complex nested subqueries
