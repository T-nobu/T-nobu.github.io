### DATABASE SYSTEM FUNDAMENTAL

What I Learned
The key principles for designing good relational databases, like minimizing nulls, avoiding redundancy, and eliminating anomalies.

The concepts of functional dependency, lossless decomposition, dependency preservation, and normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF).

Algorithms for decomposing schemas using functional dependencies to achieve BCNF and 3NF.

Introduction to multivalued dependencies and the need for 4NF and 5NF.

Understanding of atomic domains and ensuring compliance with 1NF.

Systematic database design processes from E-R modeling to normalization.

Concepts related to temporal data modeling — handling data that changes over time and ensuring temporal consistency.

Key Points
Lesson 12
Features of Good Database Design:

Separate relations for each entity.

Lesser NULL values.

No spurious tuples (lossless decomposition).

Avoid redundancy.

Avoid modification anomalies (update, deletion, insertion anomalies).

Functional Dependency Theory:

Definitions: Functional Dependency (FD), Superkey, Closure of FDs (F+).

Armstrong’s Axioms: Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity.

Canonical Cover: Simplified, non-redundant version of FDs.

Normalization:

Purpose: Reduce redundancy and avoid anomalies.

Normal Forms: 1NF → 2NF → 3NF → BCNF → 4NF → 5NF.

Algorithms:

BCNF Decomposition: Lossless, but may not preserve all FDs.

3NF Decomposition: Lossless and dependency-preserving using canonical cover.

Lesson 13
Multivalued Dependencies (MVD):

MVD occurs when attributes are independent of each other but tied to the same entity.

4NF eliminates redundancy due to MVD.

Higher Normal Forms:

5NF (PJNF): Deals with join dependencies.

DKNF: Based on domain and key constraints.

Atomic Domains and 1NF:

Values must be atomic (indivisible).

Non-atomic attributes should be split into separate attributes.

Database Design Process:

Deriving schemas from E-R diagrams.

Normalization steps applied during or after schema derivation.

Denormalization may be used for performance optimization.

Temporal Data Modeling:

Handling attributes valid over specific time periods.

Managing primary keys and foreign keys in temporal relations.

SQL:2011 standard introduces partial support for temporal data.

Points to Remember
Always design relational schemas to minimize redundancy and NULL values.

Decomposition should always be lossless; preserving functional dependencies is preferred but can sometimes be sacrificed (especially for BCNF).

Armstrong’s Axioms form the foundation for reasoning about functional dependencies.

Multivalued dependencies necessitate 4NF decomposition.

1NF enforces atomicity — no multi-valued or composite attributes allowed.

Temporal data requires additional considerations, especially for keys and foreign keys.

High-level normal forms like 5NF and DKNF are rarely applied in practice due to their complexity.

Normalization and denormalization are both important — the right balance depends on the application’s performance and consistency needs.
